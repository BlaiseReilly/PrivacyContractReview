# Privacy Contract Review System

A blockchain-based privacy-preserving contract compliance review platform utilizing Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology to enable secure and confidential analysis of contract clauses.

## üîí Core Concept

This system leverages FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) smart contracts to provide **confidential contract review** capabilities. Organizations can submit contracts for compliance analysis while maintaining complete privacy of sensitive contract terms. Authorized reviewers can analyze encrypted contract clauses without accessing the raw data, ensuring regulatory compliance while protecting trade secrets.

### Key Features

- **FHE-Powered Privacy**: Contract clauses are analyzed using homomorphic encryption, allowing computation on encrypted data
- **Confidential Compliance Analysis**: Review GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations without exposing sensitive terms
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Multi-tier authorization system (Contract Submitters, Authorized Reviewers, System Administrators)
- **Privacy-First Architecture**: Sensitive ratings and analysis results remain encrypted on-chain
- **Comprehensive Clause Analysis**: Evaluate data processing, retention, sharing, consent, security measures, and breach notification procedures

## üìÑ Smart Contract

**Deployed Contract Address**: `0x5A042B49224ae2d67d5F216DC9A243F6603848F1`

The FHE-enabled smart contract (`PrivacyContractReview.sol`) implements:
- Encrypted contract submission with public metadata
- Confidential clause-by-clause review with sensitivity ratings
- Privacy analysis aggregation (data sensitivity, GDPR/CCPA scores, risk assessment)
- Reviewer authorization management
- Compliance alert system for high-risk findings

## üîê Privacy-Preserving Workflow

1. **Contract Submission**: Users submit contract document hashes with public titles
2. **Confidential Review**: Authorized reviewers analyze individual clauses:
   - Clause type classification (data processing, retention, sharing, consent, etc.)
   - Compliance rating (0-10 scale)
   - Sensitivity level assessment (1-5 scale)
   - Encrypted review notes
3. **Privacy Analysis**: Complete analysis includes:
   - Overall data sensitivity score
   - GDPR compliance rating
   - CCPA compliance rating
   - Data retention risk assessment
   - Data sharing risk evaluation
4. **Encrypted Results**: All sensitive ratings remain encrypted on-chain, viewable only by authorized parties

## üõ°Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### Frontend
